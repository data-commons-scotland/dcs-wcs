What follows is a contrived scenario that introduces the features of WCS.

==== The scenario

For a school Nat 5 human geography, Rory needs to research trends in Scottish household waste.
Rory opens up his laptop computer and types “information about Scottish waste” into a search engine…

NOTE: The website has not been indexed yet by search engines so the above image has been mocked!

Rory sees Waste Commons Scotland at the top of the search results and decides to click on it
to see what its website has to offer…

NOTE: The web application is currently running on Heroku’s cloud
at https://waste-commons-scotland.herokuapp.com. If you try to access that web page…
Your first attempt might timeout because Heroku takes ~20 seconds to spin-up the underlying compute machine.
(I’m using Heroku’s free tier which automatically hibernates a compute machine after 30 minutes of idleness.)
Your subsequent access attempts should succeed.

Rory wonders about the provenance of the site and so click on the About menu option…

Rory thinks to himself “…fine, I wonder if I can search for trends in household waste on this website?”.
So, he clicks on the Search menu option, starts typing into the search entry box and, automatically,
a list of suggestions starts appearing…

Rory stops typing and scans the suggestions. He notices that some of the resulting suggestions are articles,
some are datasets and others are community comments; and that they have been annotated with rating stars.
Rory wonders about the basis for their ratings then he notices one of the suggestions in particular:
“DCS – Where is household waste improving?” He thinks that this promises to be informative,
and clicks on its hyperlink…

Rory discovers that the article – linked to by the search result that he clicked on - is hosted on
the same website. It contains factual but easy to understand explanatory prose and infographics;
it absolutely conveys information that will be useful for his school project.

The article provides Rory with permanent hyperlinks to embeddable versions of its infographics.
“Great” thinks Rory, “I can include copies of these graphs in my own project document!”.

Also, the article provides metadata that describes the datasets underlying the article,
including: permanent links to the datasets (e.g. to .csv, csvw or .ttl files);
timestamps of computation and caching; descriptions of derivation and sourcing (e.g. SPARLQ queries); etc.

NOTE: This embeddable infographic and dataset metadata features have not been implemented yet.

Within the metadata information, Rory sees the permanent hyperlink to the dataset that underlies
the article’s prose…

Rory clicks on that hyperlink and the dataset is loaded into his spreadsheet application…
