= Waste Commons Scotland

This repository contains the source code and build instructions for
the *Waste Commons Scotland* web application (*WCS*).

The development of WCS is one of the outcomes
of the https://www.stir.ac.uk/research/hub/contract/933675[Data Commons Scotland]
research project.

The objectives for WCS include:

* Help its user community find, understand and comment on
the _open data_ about *waste* management in Scotland.
* Be a demonstrator of the findings from the encompassing research project,
and be an archetype for future portals onto other categories of _open data_.

WARNING: The project is at an early stage and this is mostly _placeholder_ content.

== Features

What follows is a contrived scenario that introduces the features of WCS.

==== The scenario

For a school Nat 5 human geography, Rory needs to research trends in Scottish household waste.
Rory opens up his laptop computer and types “information about Scottish waste” into a search engine…

NOTE: The website has not been indexed yet by search engines so the above image has been mocked!

Rory sees Waste Commons Scotland at the top of the search results and decides to click on it
to see what its website has to offer…

NOTE: The web application is currently running on Heroku’s cloud
at https://waste-commons-scotland.herokuapp.com. If you try to access that web page…
Your first attempt might timeout because Heroku takes ~20 seconds to spin-up the underlying compute machine.
(I’m using Heroku’s free tier which automatically hibernates a compute machine after 30 minutes of idleness.)
Your subsequent access attempts should succeed.

Rory wonders about the provenance of the site and so click on the About menu option…

Rory thinks to himself “…fine, I wonder if I can search for trends in household waste on this website?”.
So, he clicks on the Search menu option, starts typing into the search entry box and, automatically,
a list of suggestions starts appearing…

Rory stops typing and scans the suggestions. He notices that some of the resulting suggestions are articles,
some are datasets and others are community comments; and that they have been annotated with rating stars.
Rory wonders about the basis for their ratings then he notices one of the suggestions in particular:
“DCS – Where is household waste improving?” He thinks that this promises to be informative,
and clicks on its hyperlink…

image::article.png[align="center"]

Rory discovers that the article – linked to by the search result that he clicked on - is hosted on
the same website. It contains factual but easy to understand explanatory prose and infographics;
it absolutely conveys information that will be useful for his school project.

The article provides Rory with permanent hyperlinks to embeddable versions of its infographics.
“Great” thinks Rory, “I can include copies of these graphs in my own project document!”.

Also, the article provides metadata that describes the datasets underlying the article,
including: permanent links to the datasets (e.g. to .csv, csvw or .ttl files);
timestamps of computation and caching; descriptions of derivation and sourcing (e.g. SPARLQ queries); etc.

NOTE: This embeddable infographic and dataset metadata features have not been implemented yet.

Within the metadata information, Rory sees the permanent hyperlink to the dataset that underlies
the article’s prose…

Rory clicks on that hyperlink and the dataset is loaded into his spreadsheet application…

== Building and running

WCS is built on https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro[Fulcro] rapid-application-development framework and its many underlying technologies.

=== Setting up the environment, tools, etc.

* Read http://book.fulcrologic.com/#_install_supporting_tools
* Google Chrome (say, version 83.0.4103.116)
** Open the developer tools console: `Cmd Option J`.
** Then customise as per http://book.fulcrologic.com/#_configure_chrome_development_setting +
also add the Fulcro Inspect extension.
* JDK 11.0.5
* Clojure 1.10.1
* npm 5.5.0
* node 8.9.1
* shadow-cljs 2.10.17
* IntelliJ IDEA (say, version Community 2020.1) +
with the Cursive plugin installed.
** `Import Project` -> choose the `deps.edn` file.

=== For an interactive development session

==== In terminal A...

Start a REPL for running the backend...
[source, bash]
-----
clj -A:dev:datomic
-----

Within the resulting REPL, start the backend...
[source, clojure]
-----
(clojure.core/require 'development)
(development/go)
-----

Useful within this REPL...
[source, clojure]
-----
(require '[datomic.api :as d])
(require '[wcs.components.datomic :refer [datomic-connections]])
(def db (d/db (:main datomic-connections)))

(def ash (d/pull db '[*] [:account/email "ash@waste-commons.scot"])) ; where :account/email uniquely identifies the entity
(pprint ash)

(d/q '[:find [?v ...] :where [?e :category/label ?v]] db)
(d/q '[:find [?v ...] :where [?e :account/name ?v]] db)
-----

==== In terminal B...

Start a REPL for transpiling the frontend...
[source, bash]
-----
npx shadow-cljs watch main
-----

==== Using Google Chrome...

* shadow-cljs server: http://localhost:9630/
* test outcomes: http://localhost:8081/
* web ui: http://localhost:3000/

==== Using Intellij IDEA...

Create a REPL configuration...
`Run/Debug Configurations' -> `Templates` -> `Clojure REPL` -> `remote` +
With the values: `nREPL` `localhost` `9000`

Run that configuration to connect to the nREPL in Google Chrome +
and select `cljs` from the dropdown...
[source, clojure]
-----
(shadow/repl :main)
(js/alert "Testing!")
-----

=== For deployment

* Generate a POM file...
[source, bash]
-----
clojure -Spom
-----
* Build the frontend...
[source, bash]
----
npx shadow-cljs release main
----
* Build the backend...
[source, bash]
----
clojure -A:depstar:dev:datomic -m hf.depstar.uberjar wcs.jar -C -m wcs.core  -v
----
* Run the backend...
[source]
----
export PORT=8085
java -jar wcs.jar
----
